## Temperature-Based-Fashion-Recommendation-System

This project was completed by Sabina Azim and Natashs Vij for their Capstone Project at the George Washington University. It was inspired by the previous fashion recommendation work done by Kai Xin Thia which he published on Towards Data Science. The images used for this project were retrieved from the DeepFashion Database. 

**Problem Statement**: Image classification models that are currently used in subscription based clothing companies can be enhanced. Improving current fashion companies' machine learning models and including new variables will provide a more personalized customer experience without human interaction, limiting the need to hire thousands of stylists.

Our project goals were to: 

1. Compare the accuracy of Convolution Neural Network models for image classification
2. Create outfit recommendations system using model with highest accuracy
3. Display outfit recommendations on a visual platform
